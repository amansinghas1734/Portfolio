                Smart Chair is an innovative embedded system designed to improve user posture and health during prolonged sitting. It uses posture sensors to detect incorrect sitting positions and alerts the user with an alarm. Users can set a custom time interval, after which the chair emits a beep to encourage movement or posture correction. The system also integrates a heart rate sensor to monitor the user's pulse in real time. It aims to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal issues and sedentary lifestyle-related problems. Smart Chair is ideal for students, professionals, and anyone with long sitting hours.
